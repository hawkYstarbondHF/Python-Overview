[Python] (https://www.python.org/)

## Running

Execute the following command from the command line.

```
python python_overview.py
```

## Testing

To run unit tests, you must first install `pytest` with the following command in the terminal:

```
pip install pytest
```

Note that Mac users may need to run this command instead:

```

Once `pytest` is installed, simply execute this command in the main project directory to run the unit tests:

```
